The Bridge Pattern is implemented with new classes ProductionFacility, TestFacility, Vaccine, Pfizer, and Moderna.

FacilityInterface is now utilized instead of Facility for more flexibility.

FacilityInterface now contains the "output" method and Facility has been refactored to "GeneralFacility" which is now used in our tests
and other classes.
